# Graphs from Educational Survey Data

This notebook visualizes categorical and numerical insights derived from an educational survey dataset, using `matplotlib` and `pandas`. The visualizations focus on analyzing participant **status**, **field of study**, and their **ratings of institutional support**.

##  About the Project

This project showcases multi-faceted data from an academic survey, intended to highlight demographic breakdowns and perception metrics across different respondent groups. The goal is to extract meaningful trends using accessible and interpretable visual formats.

Three main bar charts are included:
1. **Current Status Distribution** – Who participated: Students, Teachers, Interns, Freelancers, Employed.
2. **Field of Study Breakdown** – Subject specialization of participants.
3. **Institutional Support Ratings** – How participants rated their institutional backing, ranging from 6 to 10.

These visualizations can help researchers, academic planners, or policy analysts spot gaps and strengths in educational systems.

##  Dependencies
